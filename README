Point displacement
----------------------------------------
Point displacement is a simple QGIS Python plugin used to modify point
shapefiles where several point features have the same position. With the
normal display, it is hard to see if several features overlap.

The Point displacement plugin moves such features in a circle around the
'real' original position. As you can see this is very close to work of the
Point displacement renderer in QGIS. But while renderer only works in
render-time, this plugin creates new shapefile with shifted (displaced)
features.
