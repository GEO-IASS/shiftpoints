Shift Points
------------
Shift Points is a simple QGIS Python plugin used to modify point shapefiles
where several point features have the same position. With the normal display,
it is hard to see if several features overlap.

The Shift Points plugin moves such features in a circle around the 'real'
original position. As you can see this is very close to work of the
'Point displacement' renderer in QGIS. But while renderer only works in
render-time, this plugin creates new shapefile with shifted (displaced)
features.

                      !!! IMPORTANT !!!
This plugin now obsolete and exists only for historical reason. Please use
SEXTANTE instead. For bug reports and feature requests use SEXTANTE bugtracker
